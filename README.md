# Calculator-Application
This Java program simulates a scientific calculator similar to the one built into Windows.
The user will input their expression into a GUI which then passes that input into the Controller.
The input sent to the controller will already have been validated by the GUI class.
The controller will take input from the calculator as an infix expression, convert it to postfix,
then use a stack to perform arithmetic taking order of operations into account.
This application also allows for the use of parentheses and will validate the correct
use of parentheses in addition to validating other possible invalid input.
