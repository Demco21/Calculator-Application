# Calculator-Application
This Java program simulates a scientific calculator similar to the one built into Windows.
The user will input their expression into a GUI which then passes that input into the Controller.
The controller will take input from the calculator and add the input to a list.
This list will be the data structure for each token of the mathematical expression being input.
Calculations use a stack to perform arithmetic taking order of operations into account.
This application also allows for the use of parentheses and will validate the correct
use of parentheses in addition to validating other possible invalid input.
